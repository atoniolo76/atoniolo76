      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently adapted VLLM with my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://romethorstenson.com&#34;&gt;Rome Thorstenson&lt;/a&gt; to serve LoRA adapters for Kimi K2 thinking. Since there are so many experts (384 to be exact) in this one-trillion parameter model, we rewrote the shared memory kernel to iterate through token sorting instead of creating a buffer of len 384, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit in standard CUDA SM.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We did this change for &lt;a href=&#34;https://workshoplabs.ai&#34;&gt;Workshop Labs&lt;/a&gt;, which is a public benefit corporation for creating custom LoRA adapters on state-of-the-art models, like Kimi K2 thinking. As part of the engineering effort: digging through VLLM&amp;rsquo;s internals, reconciling module naming, and running ablation tests with randomized LoRA adapters, we were awarded $5,000 for fixing VLLM to serve LoRA adapters, and while the Yoda adapter we were given had a B matrix with zeros.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
